Welcome to mat4pat's crackme!

Rules:
1. You are not allowed to modify the .jar in any way, other then opening it.
2. Decompiling the .jar into java code is obviously cheating.


Tips:
1. Every little thing you see is meant to be.
2. The use of interent is mandatory.


Download the jar file:
1. https://mega.nz/file/ukRDELDK#bSOjiu-D0yeRZSeZNqvFNOZ3PSnD8AR_znbwKeOMdZM

Launching the jar file(two options):
1. RECOMMENDED - right click the jar file and open as a 'Java(TM) Platform SE binary' file
2. RECOMMENDED BUT NOT TOO MUCH - open cmd, cd to path of jar file, and run 'java -jar Kravitz.jar'.
3. NOT RECOMMENDED - download the whole code of the crackme(coded in Intellij),
import the code and compile it through the IDE.

Errors -

Goodluck!
